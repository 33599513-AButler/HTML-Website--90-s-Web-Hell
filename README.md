# HTML-Website--90-s-Web-Hell
A recreation of a prototypical 90's website with all the horrible limitations of basic HTML.

This will be written solely in HTML as a means of practicing using the barebones features
implemented in bog-standard HTML, complete with horribly degraded images from artefacts
and if possible low quality Gifs.
